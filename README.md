# number-plate-detection
This project detects and reads number plate in realtime with a live webcam feed and stores it in a CSV file with date, time and vehicle number.


The number plate detetcion is quite slow and it needs a clear view of the numberplate. This project was made using OpenCV and pytesseract.
OpenCV is used for the webcam feed and pytesseract is used to extract text from the detected numberplate.




Make sure to install all the required packages using **pip install -r requirements.txt**.
Run the file using **python detect.py**
